# SyntaxSensei
An Ai coding tutor 

 SyntaxSensei

SyntaxSensei is an AI-powered code mentor that analyzes your code and provides plain language suggestions to help improve your programming practices. Leveraging FastAPI, Pylint, and Python, SyntaxSensei offers actionable insights for cleaner, more efficient code.

 ##Project Overview

SyntaxSensei is designed to:
- **Analyze Code:** Run Pylint on your code to catch common issues.
- **Translate Linting Feedback:** Map Pylint messages to human-readable suggestions.
- **Empower Developers:** Provide quick, actionable feedback to help you write better code.
- **Scale Up:** Serve as a foundation for future enhancements using ML/NLP for advanced code analysis.

This project is built with production-grade practices, featuring robust logging, detailed error handling, comprehensive tests, and Docker containerization.
